<!-- Follow the steps below to complete the code challenge:

Create a <button> element on the DOM, you may do this in jQuery, or write it directly in the HTML code. Have the button text read "Generate".

Using jQuery, append a <div> element when you click the button.

Inside the <div> element you created in the previous step, create a <p> element that shows how many times you have clicked the "Generate" button from the first step.

Inside the <div> element created in step two, append two <button> elements with text of "Swap" & "Delete".

In a CSS file, any <div> created using the "Generate" button should start with red as it's background-color.

Clicking a "Swap" <button> should change its parent background-color from red to yellow (HINT: Research toggleClass).

Clicking the "Swap" <button> on a yellow div should turn the background-color to red.

Clicking a "Delete" <button> should remove its parent <div>.

No need to do anything beyond the challenge described above. Once you are complete, check your code into a GitHub repo and submit via this application.
